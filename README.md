# Mind and Body Maintenance

Mind and Body Maintenance is a site that I created to share some of my favourite sources on the topics of sleep, exercise and mindfulness. These sources will range from articles, journals, YouTube videos and websites from various experts and content creators. There is also an opportunity for users of the site to suggest their own content and suggestions for the site's function and appearance.

## Features 

Below is a list of features that I have on this site which I will detail individually - there is a nav menu for each page, and there are five pages in total - Home, Sleep, Exercise, Mindfulness and a Suggestions page. The home page has an aside which also loads up a YouTube video for each section. Within the Sleep, Exercise and Mindfulness pages, there is an iframe, table and list items which link to various external sources. There is a form for the Suggestions page to record data entered by users of the site. There is also a footer which links the user to social media pages and a link which brings users back to the top of the page if they have scrolled down to the bottom.

### Each Feature Explained

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The Nav Menu bar is located on all pages and allows for seamless flow for the user to access all the content on the site

- __Social Media and Back to Top__

  - There are links to the website Social Media pages as located in the footer. These open in a new tab.
  - There is also a back to top link which can be clicked to return to Nav menu bar at any time

- __Home Page Content__

  - Each section will follow the same layout. Below, the Sleep page of the site is shown as an example 
  - Below the short paragraph at the top of page (not included in screenshot), an iframe will load in addition to a table of sources sectioned off in different categories: Source, Video and Article - these table cells can be clicked and the user is taken to a new tab containing the information source

  - This section can also be updated by way of newly suggested content from myself or other users on the Suggestions page

- __Suggestions Page__

  - This page will allow the user to enter some basic info on the form - drop down for age group, text input for name and email address. There will be some radio button questions in there as well. All in all, it takes no time to complete and all these questions are required to be able to submit the form
  - There is a text box area for the user to enter suggestions and additional content for the site, which I can implement and give credit to the person suggesting it, if they want me to do so.

- __Suggestions Page Validation__
 - There is validation as shown below to ensure that the user is entering all the required data, be it text: text and email format, and a requirement for the radio button options to also be clicked to submit the data on the form. An error message is displayed to the user 'Please fill out this field'.

![suggestions-validation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91907661/147268935-7a029374-4aea-4c2f-ad31-58739c534a2a.png)


## Testing and Lighthouse

![lighthouse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91907661/146009134-118f8408-eefe-43b9-83e8-c9c7e1adab0d.png)

I have included the following errors and warnings I received from Validation testing and how and if they needed fixing:

- __Errors__
- The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.
  - I have removed the obsolete attribute from all instances of this element 
- Bad value assets/images/woman meditating 2.jpg for attribute src on element img: Illegal character in path segment: space is not allowed.  
  - This has now been changed to the proper format  
  
- __Warnings__
- The name attribute is obsolete (for the back to top function). Consider putting an id attribute on the nearest container instead.
  - Removed name as suggested and feature still works
- Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.
  - I have used flex with CCS on my section which contains the image, paragraph, aside and Youtube Video. A header for these sections didn't fit with my plan for layout
- Value Error : padding-left Too many values or values are not recognized: 0 10px 0 10px
  - Have changed to 0 10px and removed obsolete values  
  
### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdavid-maura-rodgers.github.io%2FDavid.Rodgers-html-css-Port.Proj.%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdavid-maura-rodgers.github.io%2FDavid.Rodgers-html-css-Port.Proj.%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Unfixed Bugs

A very small, but noticeable difference in the size of the sleeping woman image and the 2 images below (two people exercising and woman meditating) This is likely due to the content being ina a flex layout. I have tried everything I know, looked at resources online and there seems to be no error or difference in the html or CSS controlling them.

I then had to create the code below, which takes the first image and it's container to be unique - I changed the width of the viewport to 36 as opposed to 30 for the two images below it. Not ideal, but it does fix the issue.

#circle-images-sleep {
    position: relative;
    width: 36vw;
    height: 22vw;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin-left: 30px;
}

#sleep-circle {
    height: 300px;
    width: 300px; 
    border-radius: 50%;
    border: navy solid 5px;
    width: 90%;
    height: 60%;
    object-fit: cover;
}

## Deployment
